# Implementation Status

This document tracks the progress of implementing the **Lisible** medical transcription web application according to the sprint plan outlined in `TECHNICAL.md`.

## Overall Progress: 1/10 Sprints Complete

### Sprint 1: Foundation & Database Layer (COMPLETED)
**Status:** Complete
**Completed:** August 31, 2025
**Objective:** Establish core data model and database infrastructure

#### Tasks Completed:
- [x] Create Transcript model with all required properties (id, title, description, image, transcript, status, error_message, processed_at, timestamps)
- [x] Generate and configure database migration with proper column types and indexes
- [x] Implement Transcript model with appropriate relationships, accessors, and mutators for JSON handling
- [x] Create database seeders for development and testing data
- [x] Write comprehensive unit tests for model validation, JSON schema compliance, and database operations
- [x] Ensure all tests pass before proceeding to next sprint

#### Deliverables:
- **Transcript Model** (`app/Models/Transcript.php`): Complete with status management, JSON validation, scopes, and helper methods
- **Database Migration** (`database/migrations/2025_08_31_000003_create_transcripts_table.php`): Proper schema with indexes and constraints
- **Model Factory** (`database/factories/TranscriptFactory.php`): Generates realistic test data for all states
- **Database Seeder** (`database/seeders/TranscriptSeeder.php`): Creates sample data for development
- **Unit Tests** (`tests/Unit/TranscriptTest.php`): 22 tests with 68 assertions, all passing

#### Key Features Implemented:
- JSON schema validation against medical transcript structure
- Status workflow management (pending → processing → completed/failed)
- Query scopes for efficient filtering
- Soft deletes for data preservation
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Strategic database indexing for performance

#### Test Results:
```
✓ 22 tests passed (68 assertions)
✓ All model functionality verified
✓ JSON schema validation tested
✓ Status management validated
✓ Database operations confirmed
```

### Sprint 2: Job Queue Infrastructure (PENDING)
**Status:** Not Started
**Objective:** Build the asynchronous processing foundation for transcription

#### Planned Tasks:
- [ ] Implement ProcessTranscription job class with proper queue interface implementation
- [ ] Configure Laravel queue system with dedicated 'transcription' queue and appropriate timeouts
- [ ] Create job failure handling with retry logic and exponential backoff
- [ ] Implement status tracking throughout job lifecycle (pending → processing → completed/failed)
- [ ] Write unit tests for job processing, error handling, and status updates
- [ ] Set up queue monitoring and logging infrastructure

#### Expected Deliverables:
- ProcessTranscription job class
- Queue configuration and setup
- Job failure handling system
- Unit tests for job functionality
- Queue monitoring setup

---

### Sprint 3: Core Controller & API Endpoints (PENDING)
**Status:** Not Started
**Objective:** Build the main application logic and API layer

#### Planned Tasks:
- [ ] Implement TranscriptController with all CRUD operations
- [ ] Create status checking endpoint for AJAX polling
- [ ] Implement retry mechanism for failed transcriptions
- [ ] Add proper request validation and error handling
- [ ] Create API routes with appropriate middleware
- [ ] Write controller tests covering all endpoints

### Sprint 4: User Authentication & Base Layout (PENDING)
**Status:** Not Started
**Objective:** Establish user system and application shell

---

### Sprint 5: Transcript Creation Interface (PENDING)
**Status:** Not Started
**Objective:** Build the primary user entry point for new transcripts

---

### Sprint 6: Transcript Management Dashboard (PENDING)
**Status:** Not Started
**Objective:** Build comprehensive transcript listing and management interface

---

### Sprint 7: Transcript Detail & Update Interface (PENDING)
**Status:** Not Started
**Objective:** Provide detailed view and editing capabilities for individual transcripts

---

### Sprint 8: Gemini API Integration (PENDING)
**Status:** Not Started
**Objective:** Connect the application to Google's Gemini API for actual transcription

---

### Sprint 9: End-to-End Testing & Quality Assurance (PENDING)
**Status:** Not Started
**Objective:** Ensure application reliability through comprehensive testing

---

### Sprint 10: Production Readiness & Deployment (PENDING)
**Status:** Not Started
**Objective:** Prepare application for production deployment and monitoring
