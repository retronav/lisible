# Implementation Status

This document tracks the progress of implementing the **Lisible** medical transcription web application according to the sprint plan outlined in `TECHNICAL.md`.

## Overall Progress: 2/10 Sprints Complete

### Sprint 1: Foundation & Database Layer (COMPLETED)
**Status:** Complete
**Completed:** August 31, 2025
**Objective:** Establish core data model and database infrastructure

#### Tasks Completed:
- [x] Create Transcript model with all required properties (id, title, description, image, transcript, status, error_message, processed_at, timestamps)
- [x] Generate and configure database migration with proper column types and indexes
- [x] Implement Transcript model with appropriate relationships, accessors, and mutators for JSON handling
- [x] Create database seeders for development and testing data
- [x] Write comprehensive unit tests for model validation, JSON schema compliance, and database operations
- [x] Ensure all tests pass before proceeding to next sprint

#### Deliverables:
- **Transcript Model** (`app/Models/Transcript.php`): Complete with status management, JSON validation, scopes, and helper methods
- **Database Migration** (`database/migrations/2025_08_31_000003_create_transcripts_table.php`): Proper schema with indexes and constraints
- **Model Factory** (`database/factories/TranscriptFactory.php`): Generates realistic test data for all states
- **Database Seeder** (`database/seeders/TranscriptSeeder.php`): Creates sample data for development
- **Unit Tests** (`tests/Unit/TranscriptTest.php`): 22 tests with 68 assertions, all passing

#### Key Features Implemented:
- JSON schema validation against medical transcript structure
- Status workflow management (pending → processing → completed/failed)
- Query scopes for efficient filtering
- Soft deletes for data preservation
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Strategic database indexing for performance

#### Test Results:
```
✓ 22 tests passed (68 assertions)
✓ All model functionality verified
✓ JSON schema validation tested
✓ Status management validated
✓ Database operations confirmed
```

### Sprint 2: Job Queue Infrastructure (COMPLETED)
**Status:** Complete
**Completed:** Current Session
**Objective:** Build the asynchronous processing foundation for transcription

#### Tasks Completed:
- [x] Implement ProcessTranscription job class with proper ShouldQueue interface implementation
- [x] Configure Laravel queue system with dedicated 'transcription' queue and appropriate timeouts (300s)
- [x] Create job failure handling with retry logic (3 retries) and exponential backoff
- [x] Implement comprehensive status tracking throughout job lifecycle (pending → processing → completed/failed)
- [x] Write comprehensive unit tests for job processing, error handling, and status updates
- [x] Set up queue monitoring and logging infrastructure with dedicated channels

#### Deliverables:
- **ProcessTranscription Job** (`app/Jobs/ProcessTranscription.php`): Complete queue implementation with ShouldQueue interface, timeout handling, and retry logic
- **Queue Configuration** (`config/queue.php`): Dedicated 'transcription' queue with database driver and 300s retry timeout
- **Error Handling System**: Comprehensive failure handling with user-friendly error messages and permanent failure tracking
- **Status Tracking**: Full lifecycle management from job dispatch through completion or failure
- **Unit Tests** (`tests/Unit/ProcessTranscriptionTest.php`): 13 tests with 57 assertions, all passing
- **Logging Infrastructure** (`config/logging.php`): Dedicated 'transcription' and 'queue' log channels for monitoring

#### Key Features Implemented:
- ShouldQueue interface with 300-second timeout and 3-retry limit
- Exponential backoff retry strategy for resilient processing
- Comprehensive error handling with permanent failure detection
- Status tracking integration with Transcript model
- Simulation-based processing for development and testing
- Dedicated logging channels for queue operations and transcription processing
- Full job lifecycle management with proper cleanup

#### Test Results:
```
✓ 13 tests passed (57 assertions)
✓ Job instantiation and configuration verified
✓ Processing workflow and status updates tested
✓ Error handling and failure scenarios validated
✓ Queue dispatch and integration confirmed
✓ Logging infrastructure tested
```

#### Technical Implementation Details:
- **Job Class Structure**: Implements ShouldQueue with proper dependency injection
- **Queue Configuration**: Dedicated transcription queue prevents job interference
- **Error Recovery**: 3-retry limit with exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Status Management**: Automatic status updates at each lifecycle stage
- **Logging Strategy**: Dedicated channels for organized monitoring
- **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive unit tests covering all job functionality

### Sprint 3: Core Controller & API Endpoints (PENDING)
**Status:** Not Started
**Objective:** Build the main application logic and API layer

#### Planned Tasks:
- [ ] Implement TranscriptController with all CRUD operations
- [ ] Create status checking endpoint for AJAX polling
- [ ] Implement retry mechanism for failed transcriptions
- [ ] Add proper request validation and error handling
- [ ] Create API routes with appropriate middleware
- [ ] Write controller tests covering all endpoints

---

### Sprint 4: User Authentication & Base Layout (PENDING)
**Status:** Not Started
**Objective:** Establish user system and application shell

---

### Sprint 5: Transcript Creation Interface (PENDING)
**Status:** Not Started
**Objective:** Build the primary user entry point for new transcripts

---

### Sprint 6: Transcript Management Dashboard (PENDING)
**Status:** Not Started
**Objective:** Build comprehensive transcript listing and management interface

---

### Sprint 7: Transcript Detail & Update Interface (PENDING)
**Status:** Not Started
**Objective:** Provide detailed view and editing capabilities for individual transcripts

---

### Sprint 8: Gemini API Integration (PENDING)
**Status:** Not Started
**Objective:** Connect the application to Google's Gemini API for actual transcription

---

### Sprint 9: End-to-End Testing & Quality Assurance (PENDING)
**Status:** Not Started
**Objective:** Ensure application reliability through comprehensive testing

---

### Sprint 10: Production Readiness & Deployment (PENDING)
**Status:** Not Started
**Objective:** Prepare application for production deployment and monitoring
