- `POST /transcripts` - Create new transcript with file upload
- `GET /transcripts/{transcript}` - View transcript details
- `GET /transcripts/{transcript}/status` - Check processing status (AJAX API)
- `POST /transcripts/{transcript}/retry` - Retry failed transcription
- `GET /transcripts/{transcript}/edit` - Edit form view
- `PUT /transcripts/{transcript}` - Update transcript with optional new image
- `DELETE /transcripts/{transcript}` - Soft delete transcript

#### Test Coverage:
- Authentication requirements for all routes
- CRUD operations with valid and invalid data
- File upload validation and processing
- Search and filtering functionality
